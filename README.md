## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I learnt to use the picture element to provide multiple images and a fallback image for responsive design. I learnt how to add color effects to 
those images. The ordering of items on the page ie grid items.

### Continued development

I am going to continue working at creating a more streamlined work flow. I need a more systematic approach. Complete more of the Frontend Mentor challenges to build up repetition and a system.
